Welcome to ironArray Community documentation!
=============================================

ironArray Community is the open source version of ironArray.
It has been developed to mimic the same API than h5py or Zarr.
It implements the support for simple and double floating-point data using a metalayer.
With the community edition of ironArray you can extract slices from floating-point datasets in a simple way!
